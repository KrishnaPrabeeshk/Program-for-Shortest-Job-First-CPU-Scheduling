# Program-for-Shortest-Job-First-CPU-Scheduling
Problem statement : Shortest job first  is a scheduling policy that selects the waiting process with the smallest execution time to execute next.
Algorithm : 
1: Sort all the process according to the arrival time. 
2: Then select that process which has minimum arrival time and minimum Burst time. 
3: After completion of process make a pool of process which after till the completion of previous process and select that process among the pool which is having minimum Burst time.
